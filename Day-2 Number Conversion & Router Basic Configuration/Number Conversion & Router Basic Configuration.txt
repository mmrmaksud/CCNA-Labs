Number System & Router Basic Configuration

In this module, I learned two core foundational topics required for understanding networking concepts.

1. Number System Conversion:
I practiced converting numbers between different number systems used in computing:
- Binary
- Decimal
- Octal
- Hexadecimal

This helped me understand how numeric values are represented and converted across different formats in digital systems.

2. Router Basic Configuration:
I learned the fundamental concepts of routers and their basic configuration, including:
- What a router is and its role in a network
- Internal hardware components of a router
- Router interfaces and VSAT
- Types of routers: Non-modular, Modular and Chassis routers
- Basic CLI configuration concepts
  - enable password vs enable secret
  - Password encryption
- Understanding RAM and NVRAM
- Copying configuration from RAM to NVRAM
- Router configuration, reload and erase operations

Key Takeaway:
Understanding number systems and router basics is essential before moving into IP addressing and routing protocols. This module built a strong conceptual foundation for upcoming CCNA topics.
