# 🔢 Number System & Router Basic Configuration

This module focuses on two essential foundational topics required for understanding computer networking and Cisco router configuration: **Number System Conversion** and **Router Basic Configuration**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand different number systems used in computing
- Practice converting values between number systems
- Learn the basic concepts and components of routers
- Understand router types, memory and basic CLI operations

---

## 🧠 Topics Covered

### 1️⃣ Number System Conversion
In this section, I practiced converting numbers between the following number systems:

- Binary  
- Decimal  
- Octal  
- Hexadecimal  

Conversions practiced include:
- Binary ↔ Decimal, Octal, Hexadecimal  
- Decimal ↔ Binary, Octal, Hexadecimal  
- Octal ↔ Binary, Decimal, Hexadecimal  
- Hexadecimal ↔ Binary, Decimal, Octal  

This helped build a strong understanding of how numerical values are represented and converted in digital systems.
