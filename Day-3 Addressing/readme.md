# 🌐 Addressing Fundamentals (MAC Address & IPv4)

This module focuses on **network addressing concepts**, which are essential for identifying devices and enabling communication within a network. It covers both physical and logical addressing mechanisms used in computer networks.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand how devices are identified in a network
- Learn the structure and properties of IPv4 addresses
- Differentiate between network and host portions of an IP address
- Understand public and private IP addressing
- Learn the limitations of IPv4 and the need for newer IP versions

---

## 🧠 Topics Covered

### 1️⃣ MAC Address
- Definition and purpose of MAC addressing
- Role of MAC address at the Data Link Layer
- Unique hardware identification of network devices

---

### 2️⃣ IP Address (IPv4)
- Structure and properties of an IPv4 address
- Octets in an IP address
- Valid range of values in each octet (0–255)

---

### 3️⃣ IP Address Classes
- Class A, Class B and Class C addressing
- Default subnet masks associated with each class

---

### 4️⃣ Network and Host Identification
- Network bits and host bits
- Network address
- Broadcast address
- Subnet mask and its role in separating network and host portions

---

### 5️⃣ Public and Private IP Addressing
- Difference between public and private IP addresses
- Private IP address ranges and their usage

---

### 6️⃣ IP Address Assignment Methods
- Static IP address
- Dynamic IP address
- Overview of IP services related to address assignment

---

### 7️⃣ IP Versioning
- Evolution of IP versions
- Shortcomings and limitations of IPv4

---

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Conceptual understanding of networking standards
- IPv4 addressing rules and principles
- No lab configuration performed in this module (theory-based)

---

## 🧩 Key Takeaway

> Addressing is a fundamental networking concept that explains how devices are uniquely identified and how data is delivered to the correct destination.
> A strong understanding of MAC and IPv4 addressing is critical before moving into subnetting and routing topics.
