Addressing (MAC Address & IPv4)

In this module, I learned the fundamental concepts of network addressing, which are essential for identifying devices and enabling communication within a network.

Topics Covered:

1. MAC Address:
- Definition and purpose of MAC addressing
- Role of MAC address at the data link layer

2. IP Address (IPv4):
- Structure and properties of an IPv4 address
- Octets in an IP address
- Valid range of values in each octet

3. IP Address Classes:
- Class A, B and C addressing concepts
- Understanding default subnet masks

4. Network and Host Identification:
- Network bits and host bits
- Network address
- Broadcast address
- Subnet mask and its function

5. Public and Private IP Addressing:
- Difference between public and private IP addresses
- Private IP address ranges

6. IP Address Assignment:
- Static IP address
- Dynamic IP address (DHCP concept)

7. IP Services:
- Purpose and use of IP services

8. IP Versioning:
- Evolution of IP versions
- Limitations and shortcomings of IPv4

Key Takeaway:
Addressing is a core networking concept that explains how devices are uniquely identified on a network. This module built a strong foundation for understanding subnetting and routing in future topics.
