Network Fundamentals - Summary

In this module, I learned the basic concepts of computer networking and how different devices communicate with each other.

Topics Covered:
1. What is Networking – Connecting devices to share data and resources.
2. Benefits of Networking – Resource sharing, communication, scalability, and security.
3. ARPANET – The first packet-switching network, the origin of the Internet.
4. Types of Network – PAN, LAN, MAN, WAN and their coverage areas.
5. Requirements for Network Configuration – IP addressing, devices, cables, and topology.
6. Common Networking Devices – Router, Layer 2 & 3 Switch, NGFW, IPS, Access Point, Controller, Server, PoE, etc.
7. Cisco Three-Layer Hierarchical Model – Access, Distribution, Core layers.
8. Two-Tier & Spine-Leaf Architecture – Simplified and modern data center designs.
9. On-Premises vs Cloud Networking – Local vs hosted network infrastructure.
10. Fiber Optics – Single-mode and Multi-mode fiber, and their use cases.

Key Takeaway:
Networking is the foundation of all communication systems. Understanding its structure, devices, and design models is the first step to becoming a skilled network engineer.
