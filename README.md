# CCNA Labs

Welcome to the **CCNA-Labs** repository — a complete collection of practical networking labs to help you learn, practice and master the core concepts of **Cisco CCNA (200-301)** certification.

---

## 🌐 Overview
This repository contains a series of **Cisco Packet Tracer** labs, configuration files and explanations covering all major CCNA topics.  
Each lab demonstrates real-world networking scenarios using **routers, switches, PCs and servers** to build a strong practical understanding.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Strengthen your understanding of networking fundamentals  
- Practice hands-on configuration and troubleshooting  
- Learn IP addressing, routing, switching and subnetting  
- Build real-world topologies using **Cisco Packet Tracer**  
- Prepare effectively for the **CCNA 200-301 certification exam**

---

## ⚙️ Tools Used
- **Cisco Packet Tracer** (latest version recommended)  
- **Visual Studio Code / Notepad** (for config editing)  
- **Git & GitHub** (for version control and sharing)
